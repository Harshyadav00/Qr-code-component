## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As this is my first project so, I learned a lot about how to ddo research when you are stuck and finish the project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
